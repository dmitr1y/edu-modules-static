# HEXPLORE

       HEXPLORE is an intellectual computer game for one person, played on a picture shown at  the  computer screen.
    Or, alternatively, it can be viewed as a model of research activity, where the researcher has to explore the
    game area in order to solve one of the two mutually exclusive tasks. The whole picture from which the solution
    could be  seen is generated at random, and it is not visible to the researcher. At some moment, one of the two
    tasks may appear to have a better prospect, but the situation can be reversed in a few steps, so it is not certain
    up to the last  moment which of the two tasks will actually be solved.Random choice of the disposition combined
    with varying decisions of the researcher lead to an inexhaustible variety of plans and disappointments.
